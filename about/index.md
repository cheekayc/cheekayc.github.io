# Me
My name is Chee Kay Cheong. I am a graduate student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am interested in Quantitative Data Analysis, Statistical Methods, Decision Science, Machine Learning, Neural Network, and Cloud Data Storage within the public health discipline. I am preparing to be a public health data analyst. I am fortunate to have Professor Larkin McReynolds at Columbia University as my master thesis mentor during 2021-2023.
